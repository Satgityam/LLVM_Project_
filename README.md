# 🧠 Static Race Detector for CUDA Kernels

This project is a custom LLVM pass that performs **static analysis** to detect potential data races in CUDA GPU kernels at compile time.

## 🚀 Features

- Parses LLVM IR generated from `.cu` files
- Identifies memory accesses (loads/stores)
- Prints access types and locations (future: detect conflicts)
